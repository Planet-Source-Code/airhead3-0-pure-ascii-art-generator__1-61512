### Description

Converts a normal bitmap or other picture file into Ascii art that can be viewed in notepad at a certain font size (such as 1). The sample picture was made with one light-to-dark setting. With a more specific setting, you can make much more detailed pictures.

I got the idea for this program I made (under StarCraftPro username) for creating a similar coloured HTML picture generator. Bryant Zadegan's comment made me take ascii art to another level. Anyway, here it is!
